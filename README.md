# Hello-Grover-
Intro to Gith

Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry I could not take them both and be one traveler long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to where it bent in the undergrowth then took the other as just as fair and having perhaps the better claim for it was grassy and wanted wear though as for that the passing there had worn them really about the same and both that morning equally lay in leaves no step had trodden black. Oh I kept the first for another day yet knowing how way leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back. I shall telling this with a sigh. Somewhere ages and ages hence two roads diverged in a yellow wood. and I, I took the one less traveled by and that has made all the difference.
